# My Game Template Project

Welcome to my game template project repository! This project combines the power of Express.js and WebSocket to create a simple yet effective game server that supports real-time communication between clients.

## Features

- **WebSocket Communication:** Utilizes the `ws` library to enable real-time bidirectional communication between the server and clients.
- **Express Server:** Sets up a basic Express server to serve static files and handle WebSocket connections.
- **Input Handling:** Includes pre-implemented classes for handling keyboard and mouse input, making it easy to integrate user interactions into your game.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install express express-ws ws
   ```
